# Data Warehouse creation and population

Little project to solve the problem with the repetitive creation and population of data warehouses from college (being lazy with alter tables 🤡)

## Modules list:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- MySQL Connector/Python

## To do:
- [ ] Read tables and attributes from pdf
- [ ] Using the info from pdf, create the tables
- [ ] After the tables are created, read the data and populate them
- [ ] Pat on the back 👍
